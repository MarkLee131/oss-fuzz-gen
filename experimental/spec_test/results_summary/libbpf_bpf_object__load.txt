     * Goal: The fuzz driver should test `bpf_object__load` within the `libbpf` project.
     *        - libbpf is a library for loading and interacting with BPF programs in the Linux kernel.
     *        - `bpf_object__load` is a function that loads a BPF object into the kernel.
     *
     * Precondition: 1. The function is provided by the library `libbpf.h` and implemented in `libbpf.c`.
     *               2. The function `bpf_object__load` is called with the following parameters:
     *                 - @obj: a pointer to a `struct bpf_object` structure, which represents a BPF object.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Non-Null Requirement: The `obj` pointer must be non-null before calling `bpf_object__load`. If `obj` is null, the function should return an error.
     *                       b. Proper Initialization: The `bpf_object` structure pointed to by `obj` should be properly initialized, particularly ensuring that any previous pointers or lengths are correctly set or reset prior to the call to prevent unintended behavior.
     *                       c. Memory Allocation: The `obj` should be allocated using `bpf_object__open_mem` or a similar function to ensure it is a valid BPF object.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Resource Management: The @obj pointer should be properly released after the function call by using `bpf_object__close`.
     *                       b. Load Status: The function should return 0 if the BPF object is successfully loaded, or a negative error code if an error occurs.
     *                       c. Kernel Interaction: Ensure that the BPF object is correctly loaded into the kernel, and any necessary kernel resources are allocated and managed.
     *                       d. Error Handling: Properly handle any errors that occur during the loading process, ensuring that resources are not leaked.
     *
     * Postcondition: 1. The function should be called with the mutated data to test the functionality of the function, returning 0 if successful and a negative error code if an error occurs.
     *                   a. Load Validation: Ensure the BPF object is correctly loaded into the kernel, regardless of input variations.
     *                   b. Resource Management: Properly manage memory to prevent leaks or double frees, especially for fields with shared pointers.
     *                   c. Error Handling: Verify that the function correctly handles invalid inputs and returns appropriate error codes.
     *                   d. Kernel Resource Management: Ensure that any kernel resources allocated during the loading process are properly managed and released.
     *                2. Resources should be released properly after the function call. Note that the specified API is preferred to use for resource release if available.
