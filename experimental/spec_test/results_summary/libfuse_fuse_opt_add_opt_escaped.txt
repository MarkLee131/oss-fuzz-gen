     * Goal: The fuzz driver should test `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped` within the `libfuse` project.
     *       - libfuse is an open-source library that provides the reference implementation for the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) interface.
     *       - `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped` is a function that adds an option to a list of options, escaping any special characters as necessary.
     *
     * Precondition:
     * 1. The function `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped` is provided by the library `fuse_opt.h` and implemented in `fuse_opt.c`.
     * 2. The function `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped` is called with the following parameters:
     *    - @opts: a pointer to a `char *` that represents the list of options.
     *      - Precondition:
     *        a. Non-Null Requirement: The `opts` pointer must be non-null before calling `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped`. If `opts` is null, the function should handle it gracefully.
     *        b. Proper Initialization: The `char *` pointed to by `opts` should be properly initialized, particularly ensuring that any previous pointers or lengths are correctly set or reset prior to the call to prevent unintended behavior.
     *      - Postcondition:
     *        a. Resource Management: The `opts` pointer should be properly managed after the function call to prevent memory leaks.
     *    - @opt: a pointer to a `const char *` that represents the option to be added.
     *      - Precondition:
     *        a. Non-Null Requirement: The `opt` pointer must be non-null before calling `fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped`. If `opt` is null, the function should handle it gracefully.
     *        b. Proper Initialization: The `const char *` pointed to by `opt` should be properly initialized and null-terminated.
     *      - Postcondition:
     *        a. Option Addition: The option should be correctly added to the list of options, with any special characters properly escaped.
     *        b. Memory Management: Properly manage memory to prevent leaks or double frees, especially for fields with shared pointers.
     *
     * Postcondition:
     * 1. The function should be called with the mutated data to test the functionality of the function, returning 0 if successful and -1 if an error occurs.
     *    a. Option Validation: Ensure the option is correctly added to the list of options, with any special characters properly escaped.
     *    b. Memory Safety: Confirm that the function does not cause any memory leaks, buffer overflows, or other memory-related issues.
     * 2. Resources should be released properly after the function call. Note that the specified API is preferred to use for resource release if available.
