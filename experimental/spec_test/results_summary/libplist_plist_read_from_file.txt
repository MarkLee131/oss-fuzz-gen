     * Goal: The fuzz driver should test `plist_read_from_file` within the `libplist` project.
     *        - `libplist` is an open-source library to handle Apple Property List files.
     *        - `plist_read_from_file` is a function that reads a plist from a file.
     *
     * Precondition: 1. The function is provided by the library `plist.h` and implemented in `plist.c`.
     *               2. The function `plist_read_from_file` is called with the following parameters:
     *                 - @filename: a pointer to a constant character string that represents the name of the file to read from.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Non-Null Requirement: The `filename` pointer must be non-null before calling `plist_read_from_file`. If `filename` is null, the function returns `PLIST_ERR_INVALID_ARG`.
     *                       b. File Existence: The file specified by `filename` should exist and be accessible.
     *                       c. File Size: The file should not exceed `UINT32_MAX` in size.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Resource Management: The file should be properly closed after reading.
     *                       b. Memory Management: Any allocated memory should be properly freed.
     *
     *                 - @plist: a pointer to a `plist_t` structure that will store the parsed plist.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Non-Null Requirement: The `plist` pointer must be non-null before calling `plist_read_from_file`. If `plist` is null, the function returns `PLIST_ERR_INVALID_ARG`.
     *                       b. Proper Initialization: The `plist_t` structure pointed to by `plist` should be properly initialized.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Plist Storage: On successful execution, the `plist` pointer’s fields are updated to reflect the parsed plist.
     *                       b. Memory Management: The `plist` should be properly freed after use to prevent memory leaks.
     *
     *                 - @format: a pointer to a `plist_format_t` structure that will store the format of the parsed plist.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Optional: The `format` pointer can be null. If provided, it should be properly initialized.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Format Storage: On successful execution, the `format` pointer’s fields are updated to reflect the format of the parsed plist.
     *
     * Postcondition: 1. The function should be called with the mutated data to test the functionality of the function, returning appropriate error codes if an error occurs.
     *                2. Resources should be released properly after the function call. Note that the specified API is preferred to use for resource release if available.
