    /**
     * Goal: The fuzz driver should test `evhttp_bind_socket_with_handle` within the `libevent` project.
     *       - `libevent` is an event notification library that provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
     *       - `evhttp_bind_socket_with_handle` is a function that binds an HTTP server to a specified address and port, returning a handle to the bound socket.

     * Precondition: 1. The function is provided by the library `evhttp.h` and implemented in `evhttp.c`.
     *               2. The function `evhttp_bind_socket_with_handle` is called with the following parameters:
     *                 - @http: a pointer to an `evhttp` structure, which represents an HTTP server.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Non-Null Requirement: The `http` pointer must be non-null before calling `evhttp_bind_socket_with_handle`. If `http` is null, the function should return `NULL`.
     *                       b. Proper Initialization: The `evhttp` structure pointed to by `http` should be properly initialized using `evhttp_new` before calling the function.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Resource Management: The `http` pointer should be properly released after the function call by using `evhttp_free` if available.
     *                       b. State Consistency: Ensure that the state of the `evhttp` structure remains consistent after the function call.

     *                 - @address: a pointer to a `const char` that specifies the address to bind to.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Valid Address: The `address` pointer must point to a valid null-terminated string representing a valid IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
     *                       b. Non-Null Requirement: The `address` pointer must be non-null before calling `evhttp_bind_socket_with_handle`. If `address` is null, the function should return `NULL`.
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Address Usage: The `address` pointer should be used to bind the socket to the specified address.
     *                       b. Memory Management: The `address` pointer should not be modified or freed by the function.

     *                 - @port: an unsigned 16-bit integer that specifies the port to bind to.
     *                   - Precondition:
     *                       a. Valid Port: The `port` value should be within the valid range for port numbers (0-65535).
     *                   - Postcondition:
     *                       a. Port Usage: The `port` value should be used to bind the socket to the specified port.
     *                       b. Port Consistency: The `port` value should not be modified by the function.

     * Postcondition: 1. The function should be called with the mutated data to test the functionality of the function, returning a valid `evhttp_bound_socket` pointer if successful and `NULL` if an error occurs.
     *                   a. Socket Binding: Ensure the socket is correctly bound to the specified address and port.
     *                   b. Error Handling: Verify that appropriate error handling is performed if the socket cannot be bound or if listening on the socket fails.
     *                   c. Resource Management: Confirm that resources are properly managed, including closing the socket if an error occurs.
     *                   d. State Consistency: Ensure the state of the `evhttp` structure and the bound socket remains consistent after the function call.

     *                2. Resources should be released properly after the function call. Note that the specified API is preferred to use for resource release if available.
