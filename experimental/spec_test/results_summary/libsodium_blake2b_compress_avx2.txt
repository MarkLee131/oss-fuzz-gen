     * Goal: The fuzz driver should test `blake2b_compress_avx2` within the `libsodium` project.
     *        - libsodium is a widely-used library for encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
     *        - `blake2b_compress_avx2` is a function that performs a compression step in the BLAKE2b hash function using AVX2 instructions.
     *
     * Precondition:
     * 1. The function is provided by the library `blake2b.h` and implemented in `blake2b.c`.
     * 2. The function `blake2b_compress_avx2` is called with the following parameters:
     *    - @S: a pointer to a `blake2b_state` structure, which maintains the state of the BLAKE2b hash function.
     *      - Precondition:
     *          a. Non-Null Requirement: The `S` pointer must be non-null before calling `blake2b_compress_avx2`. If `S` is null, the function should not be called.
     *          b. Proper Initialization: The `blake2b_state` structure pointed to by `S` should be properly initialized, particularly ensuring that the `h`, `t`, and `f` fields are set to appropriate values.
     *      - Postcondition:
     *          a. State Update: The `h` field of the `blake2b_state` structure should be updated with the new hash state after the compression step.
     *          b. Resource Management: The `blake2b_state` structure should be properly managed to prevent memory leaks or corruption.
     *    - @block: a pointer to a 128-byte array of data to be compressed.
     *      - Precondition:
     *          a. Non-Null Requirement: The `block` pointer must be non-null and point to a valid 128-byte array.
     *      - Postcondition:
     *          a. Data Integrity: The `block` data should remain unchanged after the function call.
     *
     * Postcondition:
     * 1. The function should be called with the mutated data to test the functionality of the function, returning 0 if successful.
     * 2. Resources should be released properly after the function call.

### Detailed Specification for Creating a Fuzz Driver for `blake2b_compress_avx2` API

#### Precondition:
1. **Non-Null Requirement**:
   - The `blake2b_state` pointer (`S`) must be non-null before calling `blake2b_compress_avx2`.
   - The `block` pointer must be non-null and point to a valid 128-byte array.

2. **Proper Initialization**:
   - The `blake2b_state` structure (`S`) should be properly initialized, ensuring that the `h`, `t`, and `f` fields are set to appropriate values.

3. **Input Size**:
   - The input data size must be at least the size of `blake2b_state` plus 128 bytes (BLAKE2B_BLOCKBYTES).

#### Postcondition:
1. **State Update**:
   - The `h` field of the `blake2b_state` structure should be updated with the new hash state after the compression step.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - The `block` data should remain unchanged after the function call.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - The `blake2b_state` structure should be properly managed to prevent memory leaks or corruption.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function should return 0 if successful.

#### Steps to Create the Fuzz Driver:
1. **Initialize the Library**:
   - Use `sodium_init()` to initialize the `libsodium` library.

2. **Check Input Size**:
   - Ensure the input data is large enough to contain both a `blake2b_state` structure and a 128-byte block.

3. **Split Input Data**:
   - Split the input data into the `blake2b_state` and the 128-byte block.

4. **Initialize Structures**:
   - Initialize the `blake2b_state` structure with the provided input data.

5. **Call the API**:
   - Call `blake2b_compress_avx2` with the initialized `blake2b_state` and the block data.

6. **Postcondition Checks**:
   - Verify the state update and data integrity as per the postconditions.

7. **Return**:
   - Return 0 after the function call.
